## Introduction

Due to strict data consistency requirements in dominions, arbitrarily modifying certain data may cause serious issues.
To ensure data consistency, modifications to `DominionDTO`, `GroupDTO`, and `MemberDTO` objects
must, in principle, be performed through the Provider methods provided by the API.

### [DominionProvider](https://lunadeermc.github.io/DominionAPI/cn/lunadeer/dominion/providers/DominionProvider.html)
### [GroupProvider](https://lunadeermc.github.io/DominionAPI/cn/lunadeer/dominion/providers/GroupProvider.html)
### [MemberProvider](https://lunadeermc.github.io/DominionAPI/cn/lunadeer/dominion/providers/MemberProvider.html)

These Provider methods check for compliance before modifying data and trigger corresponding events after modification to
ensure data consistency and integrity.

For example, to change the name of a dominion:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

class ChangeDominionNameExample {

    public void changeDominionName(DominionDTO dominion, String newName) {
        CompletableFuture<DominionDTO> changed = DominionProviderHandler.getInstance().renameDominion(
                Bukkit.getConsoleSender(),
                dominion,
                newName
        );
        if (changed.get() == null) {
            // change failed
        } else {
            // change success
        }

    }
}
```

## Operation Identity

All methods provided by the Provider require a `CommandSender` parameter, which represents the identity performing the
operation.

This parameter determines the permissions and source of the operation. For example, if you want to simulate a player
performing the operation, you can pass in a `Player` object.
If you want to bypass basic checks (such as permission checks, but basic compliance checks will still be performed), you
can pass in `Bukkit.getConsoleSender()` to simulate the highest privilege operation from the console.
