Author's rant: Why do you all want to use Dominion to control things outside of dominions?

:::

By modifying this configuration file, you can control the behavior of areas in a world that are not covered by any dominion.

To enable this feature, please open the file corresponding to the world in the `world-wide` folder.
Then change `enabled` to `true`. Subsequently, modify the permissions as needed.

Finally, reload the configuration with `/dominion reload config` to take effect.
