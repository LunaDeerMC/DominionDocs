## FAQ

### Q: Installed economy provider but getting "Missing economy provider"

A: If you are using VaultUnlocked as your economy provider, it is recommended to replace it with Vault. Due to some compatibility issues with VaultUnlocked, some plugins may not correctly recognize the economy provider.

### Q: Server Mod items cannot be protected

A: Unfortunately, the plugin cannot detect the placement and breaking events of Mod items in hybrid cores (such as Mohist, etc.) unless the hybrid core supports it. Therefore, protection for these items cannot be implemented. Please submit a request to the hybrid core developers.

## Encountering Unsolvable Errors

1. First, confirm if your plugin is the latest version. If not, please update it: [Latest Download](https://github.com/LunaDeerMC/Dominion/releases/latest)

2. If you are using a fork of a mainstream server core (Paper, Folia, Purpur) such as Luminol, Lophine, DeerFolia, etc., please try to reproduce the issue on the upstream core of that fork. If the issue cannot be reproduced, it indicates a problem with the core fork. It is recommended to contact the author of the corresponding fork for resolution.

3. If the problem persists after updating, you can seek help in the group chat: [Click to join QQ Group](https://qm.qq.com/q/WB9cJ55I0a) (Note: Support might be primarily in Chinese).
Please describe your problem politely and clearly, ask if others have encountered similar issues, and provide necessary error information.

4. If no one in the group chat can help you, or if you wish to report the issue directly to the developer, you can go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LunaDeerMC/Dominion/issues/new/choose)
Fill in the issue according to the template and submit it. Please ensure you provide enough information for the developer to reproduce and solve the problem, including but not limited to: enabling debug mode in the configuration file, providing complete error logs, and describing the server environment you are using (such as Minecraft version, server software and its version, etc.).

::: info Why submit Issues instead of contacting the developer directly?

First, this plugin is completely free and open source. The author has their own work and life and cannot guarantee timely handling of all issues. Second, public Issues allow more people to see and participate in the discussion, and other users may have encountered similar problems and provided solutions. Finally, public Issues help build a knowledge base, making it easier for future users to find and solve problems.

Additionally, if you do not submit an Issue, the developer may forget your problem due to various reasons, resulting in the problem not being resolved.
