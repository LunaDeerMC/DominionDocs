::: info This feature was introduced in Dominion version 4.4.0.

:::

By setting the `enable` of the corresponding flag to `dynamic`, you can use permission nodes to precisely control which
players can use this flag.
For players without the permission node, the flag will be visible but its value cannot be modified (the value will be
the one set by `default`).

The format of the permission node is `dominion.flag.environment.<flag_name>`, where `<flag_name>` is the name of the
flag.

```yaml {4}
environment:
  tnt_explode:
    default: false
    enable: dynamic
```

For example, the above configuration sets `environment.tnt_explode`'s `enable` to `dynamic`, which means:

- All players can see the `tnt_explode` setting on the territory settings page;
- Only players with the `dominion.flag.environment.tnt_explode` permission node can modify its value;
- For players without the permission node, the value of `tnt_explode` in their territory will be `false` (i.e., the
  value set by `default`).
