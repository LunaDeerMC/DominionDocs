On the permission group list, find the group you want to delete and click the [DELETE] button in front of it to remove the group:

![](/player/group/delete/1.png)

:::: info

After a permission group is deleted, the players in the group will be automatically removed (they will not be removed from the dominion), so you can proceed with confidence.
