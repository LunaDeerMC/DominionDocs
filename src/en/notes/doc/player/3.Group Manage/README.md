By adding members to a permission group, you can easily assign the same permissions to multiple members.
This saves time and effort by eliminating the need to configure permissions for each member individually.

To simplify the permission structure, once a member is added to a permission group, \*\*its permissions cannot be
configured individually\*\*.
If you wish to configure permissions individually for a member in the group, please remove them from the permission
group.

In the dominion management interface, click on [GROUPS] to view all the current permission groups for the
dominion:
