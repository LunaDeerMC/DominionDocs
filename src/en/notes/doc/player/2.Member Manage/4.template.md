Permission templates are predefined sets of permissions. With permission templates, you can quickly configure predefined
permission rules for members to avoid repetitive work.

## Create

To use a permission template, you must first create one.

Click on [TEMPLATES] in the main menu to enter the template list:

![](/player/member/template/1.png)

Click on [CREATE] at the top of the list, and input a template name as prompted to create a permission template:

![](/player/member/template/2.png)

![](/player/member/template/3.png)

## Configure

In the template list, click [SETTING] in front of the respective template to set its permission configuration:

![](/player/member/template/4.png)

![](/player/member/template/5.png)

## Use

After configuring the template, you can apply it to other players. On the corresponding player's permission
configuration page, click [Apply Template]:

![](/player/member/template/6.png)

The created permission template will appear; click [APPLY] in front of the desired template to apply the template's
permission set to the player:

![](/player/member/template/7.png)

:::: tip

When you modify the permissions in the template, the permissions of players who previously applied the template will *
*not be affected**, because applying the template is a one-way operation.
You can further adjust the player's permissions after applying the template to meet fine-grained control requirements;
this will not affect the template configuration.
If you wish to configure permissions for multiple players simultaneously, please refer to the permission group feature.
