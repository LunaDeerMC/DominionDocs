A sub-dominion is a sub-area of a dominion. Each sub-dominion has its own independent permission system and is not
affected by the permissions of its parent dominion.

In theory, sub-dominions can be nested infinitely (the specific depth depends on the server owner's configuration in the
config file). Through sub-dominions, you can enable special functionalities such as opening a specific area within your
dominion to external players.

To create a sub-dominion, first use the land selection tool (default is the arrow), then left-click to select the first
point and right-click to select the second point of the cuboid area of the dominion.

Then, use the command:

```
/dominion create_sub <sub-dominion name> <parent dominion name>
```

This will complete the creation.
