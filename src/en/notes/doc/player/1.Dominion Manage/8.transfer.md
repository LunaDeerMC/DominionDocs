By transferring the dominion, you can hand over its ownership to another player; however, sub-dominions cannot be
transferred,
and all sub-dominions will be transferred to the respective player along with the dominion.

To transfer a dominion, use the following command:

```
/dom give <dominion_name> <player_name>
```

Similarly to deleting a dominion, transferring a dominion is a risky and irreversible operation. Therefore, add the
`force`
parameter at the end of the command to actually complete the transfer:

```
/dom give <dominion_name> <player_name> force
```
