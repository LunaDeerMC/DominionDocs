## Dominion Teleportation

Players can use the `/dominion tp <dominion_name>` command to teleport to the designated dominion's teleport point.

By default, a dominion uses its center as the teleport point. To change the teleport point, click on `[SET TP]` in
the dominion management interface to set your current location as the new teleport point.

## Notification Messages

Players will see a notification message when they enter or leave a dominion, which indicates the dominion they are
currently in:

![](/player/dominion/other/2.png)

To set the notification messages, click on `[ENTER MSG]` or `[LEAVE MSG]` in the dominion management interface to
configure the message shown when players enter or leave the dominion:

![](/player/dominion/other/4.png)

Dominion notification messages support PlaceholderAPI as well as three built-in special placeholders:

- `{OWNER}`: Dominion owner's name;
- `{DOM}`: Dominion name;
- `{PLAYER}`: The name of the player triggering the message;

These placeholders will be automatically replaced with the corresponding content to provide richer notifications.

:::: info PlaceholderAPI
The three built-in placeholders in this plugin can be used directly. For PlaceholderAPI placeholders, the server owner
must install the PlaceholderAPI plugin correctly.

## Map Color

After the server owner installs the Dynmap or BlueMap satellite map plugin and enables dominion rendering, you can
configure the dominion's display color on the satellite map using this setting:

![](/player/dominion/other/5.png)

The color must be a hexadecimal value starting with `#`, for example, `#FF0000` represents red, `#00FF00` represents
green, and `#0000FF` represents blue. You can use online color pickers to find the value for your preferred color.
