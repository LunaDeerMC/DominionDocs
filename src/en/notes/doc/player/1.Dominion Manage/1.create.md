Dominions support both manual creation and automatic creation.

## 1. Manual Creation

You need to use the area tool (default is the arrow). First, left-click to select the first point of the cuboid area
defining the dominion, then right-click to select the second point. After that, use the
`/dominion create <dominion_name>` command to create the dominion. The dominion name must be unique.

## 2. Automatic Creation

No need to select diagonal points; a dominion will be automatically created with the player at the center. Use
`/dominion` to open the main menu, then click on Create Dominion:

![](/player/dominion/create/1.png)

In the pop-up UI, enter the name of the dominion you want to create:

![](/player/dominion/create/2.png)

After entering the name, left-click the green concrete in the center at the bottom to automatically create a dominion:
