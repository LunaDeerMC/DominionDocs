A guest is defined relative to members. When a player does not belong to the dominion's members, they are considered a
guest and are subject to guest permissions.

Open the management page of the corresponding dominion and click on `[GUEST]`:

![](/player/dominion/guest/1.png)

Then configure what guests can do within the dominion:

![](/player/dominion/guest/2.png)
