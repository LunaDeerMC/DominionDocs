Dominion environment behavior mainly refers to events that are not directly related to players, such as creeper
explosions, flame spreading, specific mob spawning, etc.
Disabling these behaviors can prevent damage to the dominion from non-human causes.

Open the management page of the corresponding dominion and click on `[ENV]`:

Then you can enable or disable the corresponding behaviors within the dominion:
